# Archive

This folder keeps legacy project snapshots for reference only.

- `archive/project/` is an archived copy of the older duplicate tree that previously lived at `/project`.
- Active development and runnable commands use the repository root (`/workspace/project_atlas`) with source code in `src/`.
